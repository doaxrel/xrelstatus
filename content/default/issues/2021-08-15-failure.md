**Software problem:** Due to a new version of a Docker image, one of our components no longer starts. Investigating...
\
It actually turned out that the Docker image was not the problem, but that a backup process was hanging and causing weird errors
on startup of an in-memory database.
\
Database replication was re-setup and backup process improved.
